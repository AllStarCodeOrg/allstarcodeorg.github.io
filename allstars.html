Nate believes, “All Star Code is perfect for anyone, even if you don’t have a desire to study programming specifically or are unsure. It helps its students in teamwork, public speaking, and developing startups.” </p> <p>Nate was a strong leader to his peers throughout the whole summer, ultimately working as the project manager for his group’s final project, Near Me!, an app for finding local events. He continues that leadership today as Cohort President, a position which he was voted into by his peers, where his responsibilities include keeping his cohort connected for life.</p> <p>Nate sees himself going on to continue independent study of many of the topics introduced during the SI as well as further develop his personal brand: NATE+ (<a target="_blank" class="storylink" href="http://nateplus.co">nateplus.co</a>).</p> <p>Check out more stories like Nate’s, and see how All Star Code continues to foster excellence by thumbing through our <a target="_blank" class="storylink" href="http://www.allstarcode.org/reports/">2016 Annual Report</a>.</p>'

He stayed late to get tutoring with the things he was struggling with, but he also used this time to show those places where he excelled. Working late with Shuh, Cyril found out that he built his own computer and creates instructional YouTube videos for others hoping to do the same.</p> <p>Cyril and Shuh also did some extracurricular hacking of a USB car charger to create a DIY portable cellphone charger. Shuh’s final project married his new and hardwon web design skills with his interest in political activism to create Rally, a platform for people to find grassroots organizations in the causes that are important to them.</p> <p>Check out more stories like Shuh’s, and see how All Star Code continues to foster excellence by thumbing through our <a target="_blank" class="storylink" href="http://www.allstarcode.org/reports/">2016 Annual Report</a>.</p>'

Since 2014, The Young Hackers has successfully built a strong community of young programmers through workshops, hackathons, and various collaborative projects. Before Austin and Mamadou graduated high school, they built a team of leaders to “pass on the torch” so that The Young Hackers can continue to function as a hub for up-and-coming high school programmers.</p> <p>Isiah Rosa, a 2015 ASC Alum, dared greatly taking on the leadership role of Co-Director for the Young Hackers this year, as Mamadou and Austin went off to college on the West Coast. Isiah spoke to the 2016 SI students this summer to get them engaged and continue the strong path from ASC to Young Hackers.</p> <p>Isiah is currently attending The High School for Math, Science and Engineering.

				'text' : '<p>Djassi told his story at the Campaign for Black Male Achievement Conference (Rumble Young Man Rumble) in Louisville, KY. He stood up in front of approximately 100 attendees and shared his path to computer science/ tech diversity and the impact that All Star Code has had on his life. He even shared that he aspires to be on the cover of Forbes one day.</p> <p>Following Rumble Young Man Rumble, Djassi gave a speech to tech entrepreneurs at the ReThink Education Summit in New York. He spoke about his journey growing up in Harlem, his education, and his realization that many opportunities were not available to him. “It took me my first two years of high school to realize that I didn’t have access to these opportunities because I was black. I felt disrespected, excluded, but above all else I felt ready to flip the script.”</p> <p>That’s when Djassi found All Star Code. Djassi attended ASC’s Design a Startup in a Day workshop and had ”one of the best Saturdays of my life.” When the Summer Intensive application launched, Djassi filled it out as fast as he could and was admitted into the inaugural Summer Intensive program.</p> <p>“I left All Star Code more confident and optimistic than I had ever been my whole life.” Djassi kept coding outside of class and started attending hackathons at colleges across the country. He returned to the Summer Intensive in 2015 as a Teaching Fellow to give back to the organization.</p> <p>“All Star Code gave me the confidence to look inside myself and realize that I’m capable of doing whatever I put my mind to. No other learning environment has taught me as much as ASC did, which is why we need more programs like it. If I had classes at school that were taught ASC style, we’d be pumping out Bill Gates-es nonstop! We have to rethink the way we educate kids in America, because when kids like me discover their potential, that’s when we realize that we can change the world.”</p> <p>Djassi is currently attending Harvey Mudd College and majoring in Computer Science.

Jared built strong relationships with the teaching staff, particularly Teaching Fellow and 2014 Alum Austin Carvey.</p> <p>During Demo Day week, Jared stayed at Austin’s house one night and Austin helped him with his project, TweetSweep. As a website, TweetSweep is a tool that aims to help people keep their communities clean using the power of social media. Utilizing Twitter and Google Maps APIs, TweetSweep will locate where trash is in your neighborhood for other people to find and clean up.</p> <p>Jared and Austin stayed up late and Austin showed him specific tricks for working with Firebase in Python, instead of Javascript. Jared also learned how to use the Twitter API without a browser, which helped him finalize TweetSweep.</p> <p>Jared is currently attending The Masters School in Dobbs Ferry.

				'text' : '<p>“We had an epic fail with Arduinos when I was a Teaching Fellow during the 2015 SI. We took the Arduinos (a type of hardware) out of the boxes and figured that, as hackers, we would instinctively be able to figure them out. Turns out, we couldn’t turn them on or even figure out how to plug them in.</p> <p>It wasn’t just the hardware, but also the software. It was a daylong struggle learning how to upload content. Then, the transition from one language, Python, to another, C, was not as smooth as we anticipated.</p> <p>The students were having a lot of trouble figuring out what code to put where. However, in the midst of all of this, the class had a lot of fun failing together. Surprisingly, our cohort ended up having an amazing Arduino project for Demo Day (Trigger Safe, made by Sam Jurcic, Francis Rivera, & Henry Cedillo). Sam, Francis, and Henry worked on most of the code by themselves and were really on point. It ended up being one of the favorite projects for Demo Day and was featured at the 2016 Summer Benefit.”</p> <p>Devon is currently attending the Bronx High School of Science.
